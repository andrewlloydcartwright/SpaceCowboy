## Long live the Space Cowboy!

*Made with love, frustration, Corona SDK, and Lua. But mostly love and frustration.*

**Instructions:**
Mr. Space Cowboy will remain horizontally stationary on the left side of the screen as you control his jumps and his blaster! Tap on the left half of the screen to make him leap upwards and tap on the right half to make him blast any and all meteors and aliens out of his path!
